# Fibonacci TDD (Test Driven Development)
TDD (Test Driven Development) applied to develop a algorithm to generate the Fibonacci sequence.  

## Fibonacci sequence
From [Wikipedia, Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):  
> In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n), form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is:
> 
> F0 = 0, F1 = 1 
> 
> F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
> 
> The beginning of the sequence is thus:
> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
